# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of the pyber analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type And create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.For getting this,I will work with two csv file,city_data.csv and ride_data.csv.I will load and read that files and make two dataframe.Then i will merge both dataframe and make new one to do my pyber analysis.With the help of dataframes I will write code and get results.

### Results:
* get the total number of rides, total number of drivers,and the total fares for each city type.
*  Then, calculate the average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each city type.
*   Finally, add this data to a new DataFrame, then format the columns.

*A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type.create a multiple-line graph that shows the total fares for each week by city type.

Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)

Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities(a great difference) among the city types.There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)Finally, youâ€™ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
